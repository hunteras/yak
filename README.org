#+TITLE: What is yak?

  Yak[fn:yak] is the record of my exploration of programs.

* What is =string=?
  String is a sequece of char, supports sequece manipulation and different char type with different encodings.

** In C++ STL
  Char type is char or wchar_t, sequece operations are implemented with iterators.
  
*** What is =char= and =wchar_t=?
   
*** What's the difference between =std::string= and =std::wstring=[fn:1]?
